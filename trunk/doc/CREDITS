Unbound was developed at NLnet Labs by Wouter Wijngaards.

Unbound was devised by Bill Manning, David Blacka, and Matt Larson 
from the University of California and from Verisign. The Java prototype
was made in further cooperation with Geoff Sisson and Roy Arends from Nominet.

At NLnet Labs, Jelte Jansen and Mark Santcroos reviewed the unbound C sources.
