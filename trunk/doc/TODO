TODO items. These are interesting todo items.
o understand synthesized DNAMEs, so those TTL=0 packets are cached properly.
o NSEC/NSEC3 aggressive negative caching, so that updates to NSEC/NSEC3 
  will result in proper negative responses.
o (option) where port 53 is used for send and receive, no other ports are used.
o (option) to not send replies to clients after a timeout of (say 5 secs) has
  passed, but keep task active for later retries by client.
o (option) private TTL feature (always report TTL x in answers).
o (option) pretend-dnssec-unaware, and pretend-edns-unaware modes for workshops.
o delegpt use rbtree for ns-list, to avoid slowdown for very large NS sets.
o (option) reprime and refresh oft used data before timeout.
o (option) retain prime results in a overlaid roothints file.
o (option) store primed key data in a overlaid keyhints file (sort of like drafttimers).
o windows version, auto update feature, a query to check for the version.
o command the server with TSIG inband. get-config, clearcache, 
	get stats, get memstats, get ..., reload, clear one zone from cache
o NSID rfc 5001 support.
o timers rfc 5011 support.
o Treat YXDOMAIN from a DNAME properly, in iterator (not throwaway), validator.
o make timeout backoffs randomized (a couple percent random) to spread traffic.
o inspect date on executable, then warn user in log if its more than 1 year.
o (option) proactively prime root, stubs and trust anchors, feature.
  early failure, faster on first query, but more traffic.
o library add convenience functions for A, AAAA, PTR, getaddrinfo, libresolve.
o library add function to validate input from app that is signed.
o add dynamic-update requests (making a dynupd request) to libunbound api.
o SIG(0) and TSIG.
o support OPT record placement on recv anywhere in the additional section. 
o add local-file: config with authority features.
o (option) to make local-data answers be secure for libunbound (default=no)
o (option) to make chroot: copy all needed files into jail (or make jail)
	perhaps also print reminder to link /dev/random and sysloghack.
o overhaul outside-network servicedquery to merge with udpwait and tcpwait,
  to make timers in servicedquery independent of udpwait queues.
o check into rebinding ports for efficiency, configure time test.
o EVP hardware crypto support.
o option to ignore all inception and expiration dates for rrsigs.
o cleaner code; return and func statements on newline.
o memcached module that sits before validator module; checks for memcached
  data (on local lan), stores recursion lookup.  Provides one cache for multiple resolver machines, coherent reply content in anycast setup.
o no openssl_add_all_algorithms, but only the ones necessary, less space.
o listen to NOTIFY messages for zones and flush the cache for that zone
  if received.  Useful when also having a stub to that auth server.
  Needs proper protection, TSIG, in place.

*** Features features, for later
* dTLS, TLS, look to need special port numbers, cert storage, recent libssl.
* aggressive negative caching for NSEC, NSEC3.
* multiple queries per question, server exploration, server selection.
* support TSIG on queries, for validating resolver deployment.
* retry-mode, where a bogus result triggers a retry-mode query, where a list
  of responses over a time interval is collected, and each is validated.
  or try in TCP mode. Do not 'try all servers several times', since we must
  not create packet storms with operator errors.
o on windows version, implement that OS ancillary data capabilities for
  interface-automatic. IPPKTINFO, IP6PKTINFO for WSARecvMsg, WSASendMsg.
o local-zone directive with authority service, full authority server 
  is a non-goal.
o infra and lame cache: easier size config (in Mb), show usage in graphs.

1.3.1:
- spoofed delegpt fixes - if DNSKEY prime fails
	- set DNSKEY bogus and DNSKEY query msg bogus.
	- make NS set bogus too - if not validated as secure.
	- check where queries go - otherwise reduce TTL on NS.
	- also make DS NSEC bogus. Also DS msg cache entry.
- mark bogus under stringent conditions
	- if DS at parent and validly signed. Then DNSKEY must exist.
	- Also for trust anchor points themselves. DNSKEY must exist.
	- so if then DNSKEY keyprime fails
	  - then it is not simply a server that only answers qtype A.
	  - then parent is agreeing (somewhat) with the DS record
	  - but it could still be a lame domain, these exist 
	    The objective is to keep tries for genuinely lame domains to a
	    minimum, while detecting forgeries quickly. exponential backoff.
	- for unbound we can check if we got something to verify while
	  building that chain of trust.  If so - not lame, agressive retry.
	  - but security-lame zones also exist and should not pose 
	    too high a burden. Exponential backoff again.
	    (fe. badly signed or dnskey reply too large fails).
	- the delegation NS for the domain is bogus.
	  The referral retried, with exponential backoff.
	  This exponential backoff should go towards values which are close
	  to the TTLs that are used now (on lame delegations for example).
	  so that the extra traffic is manageable.
	- for unbound, reset the TTL on the NS rrset. Let it timeout.
	  Set NS rrset bogus - no more queries to the domain are done.
	  Also set DNSKEY and DS (rrset, NSEC, msg) bogus and ttl like that.
	  (to the same absolute value, so a clean retry is done).
	  TTL of NS is (rounddown) timeout in seconds.
	  Until the NS times out and referral is done again.
	  Make sure multiple validations for chains of trust do not result
	  in a flood of queries or backoff too quickly.
- bogus exponential backoff cache. hash(name,t,c), size(1M, 5%).
	TTL of 24h.  Backoff from 200msec to 24h.
	x2 on bogus(18 tries), x8 backoff on lameness(6 tries), 
	  when servfail for DNSKEY.
	remove entry when validated as secure.
	delegptspoofrecheck on lameness when harden-referral-path NS
	query has servfail, then build chain of trust down (check DS,
	then perform DNSKEY query) if that DNSKEY query fails servfail,
	perform the x8 lameness retry fallback.
- winevent - poll if too many fds
- fix indent #  ifs

later
- selective verbosity; ubcontrol trace example.com
- option to log only bogus domainname encountered, for demos
- cache fork-dump, pre-load
- for fwds, send queries to N servers in fwd-list, use first reply.
  document high scalable, high available unbound setup onepager.
- prefetch DNSKEY when DS in delegation seen (nonCD, underTA).
- use libevent if available on system by default(?), default outgoing 256to1024
