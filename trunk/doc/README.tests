README unbound tests

There is a test setup for unbound.

testdata/ contains the data for tests. 
testcode/ contains scripts and c code for the tests.

do-tests.sh : runs all the tests in the testdata directory.
testbed.sh : compiles on a set of (user specific) hosts and runs do-tests.

Tests are run using tpkg.
