README unbound tests

There is a test setup for unbound. Use
	make test
To make and run the tests. The results are summarized at the end.
You can also run ./unittest by hand, if the system lacks other debug tools.

testdata/ contains the data for tests. 
testcode/ contains scripts and c code for the tests.

do-tests.sh : runs all the tests in the testdata directory.
testbed.sh : compiles on a set of (user specific) hosts and runs do-tests.

Tests are run using testcode/mini_tpkg.sh.
