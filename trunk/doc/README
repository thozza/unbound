* Download the latest version of this software from 
  	http://unbound.net 
  or get a beta version from the svn repository at 
  	http://unbound.net/svn/

* Needs the following libraries
  * ldns	http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/ldns/			(BSD license)
  * libevent	http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/		(BSD license)

* Create build environment 
  * run libtoolize -c if config.sub is missing.
  * autoreconf (autoheader && autoconf), if ./configure is missing.

* Make and install: ./configure; make
  * --with-ldns=/path/to/ldns
  * --with-libevent=/path/to/libevent
  	Can be set to either the system install or the build directory.
	--with-libevent=no gives a builtin alternative implementation.
  * --without-pthreads 
	This disables pthreads, and uses Solaris thr library or no threading. 
	Without this option the pthreads library is detected automatically.

Known issues
------------
o If libevent is older (1.3 and before), unbound will exit instead of reload
  on sighup. On a restart 'did not exit gracefully last time' warning is 
  printed. Perform ./configure --with-libevent=no or update libevent, rerun 
  configure and recompile unbound to make sighup work correctly.

Acknowledgements
----------------
o Thanks to David Blacka and Matt Larson (Verisign) for the unbound-java
  prototype. Design and code from that prototype has been used to create
  this program. Such as the iterator state machine and the cache design.
o Other code origins are from the NSD (NLnet Labs) and LDNS (NLnet Labs)
  projects. Such as buffer, region-allocator and red-black tree code.
o See Credits file for contributors.
