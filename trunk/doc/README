* Needs the following libraries
  * ldns	http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/ldns/			(BSD license)
  * libevent	http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/		(BSD license)

* Make and install: ./configure; make
  * --with-ldns=/path/to/ldns
  * --with-libevent=/path/to/libevent
  	Can be set to either the system install or the build directory.
	--with-libevent=no gives an alternative to libevent (based on select).

* Create build environment 
  * run libtoolize -c if config.sub is missing.
  * autoreconf (autoheader && autoconf), if ./configure is missing.

Known issues
------------
o If libevent is older (1.3 and before), unbound will exit instead of reload
  on sighup. On a restart 'did not exit gracefully last time' warning is 
  printed. Perform ./configure --with-libevent=no or update libevent, rerun 
  configure and recompile unbound to make sighup work correctly.
