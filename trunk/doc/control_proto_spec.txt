Specification for the unbound-control protocol.

Server listens on 953 TCP (localhost by default). Client connects,
SSLv3 or TLSv1 connection setup (server selfsigned certificate, 
client has cert signed by server certificate).

Query and Response
------------------
Client sends 
	UBCT [commandline] \n
	fixed string UBCT, then an ascii text line, with a command, 
	some whitespace allowed. Line ends with '\n'.

Server executes command. And sends reply in ascii text over channel, 
closes the channel when done.
	in case of error the first line of the response is:
		error <descriptive text possible> \n
	or the remainder is data of the response.
