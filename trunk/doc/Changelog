	- outside network serviced queries, contain edns and tcp fallback,
	  and udp retries and rtt timing.

	  not fit, and will leave out (whole)rrsets from additional if needed.

1 May 2007: Wouter
	- decompress query section, extremely lenient acceptance.
	  But only for answers from other servers, not for plain queries.
	- compression and decompression test cases.
	- some stats added.
	- example.conf interface: line is changed from 127.0.0.1 which leads
	  to problems if used (restricting communication to the localhost),

	- checklocks zeroes its destroyed lock after checking memory areas.
	- unit test for alloc.
	- identifier for union in checklocks to please older compilers.

	- Testbed works with threading (different machines, different options).
	- alloc work, does the special type.

	- Signals, libevent and threads work well, with libevent patch and
	  changes to code (close after event_del).

	  Thread_join is replaced with waitpid. 
	- During reloads the daemon will temporarily handle signals,
	  so that they do not result in problems.
	- Also randomize the outgoing port range for tests.
	- If query list is full, will stop selecting listening ports for read.
	  This makes all threads service incoming requests, instead of one.
	  No memory is leaking during reloads, service of queries, etc.
	- test that uses ldns-testns -f to test threading. Have to answer
	  three queries at the same time.
	- with verbose=0 operates quietly.

26 February 2007: Wouter
	- ub_random code used to select ID and port.
	- log code prints thread id.

	  except the listening ports. Then the config file is reread.
	  And everything is started again (and listening ports if needed).
	- Ports for queries are shared.
	- config file added interface:, chroot: and username:.
	- config file: directory, logfile, pidfile. And they work too.

	- will not create ip6 sockets if ip6 not on the machine.

15 February 2007: Wouter

	- malloc rndstate, so that it is aligned for access.
	- fixed rbtree cleanup with postorder traverse.
