	- Can do reloads on sigHUP. Everything is stopped, and freed,
	  except the listening ports. Then the config file is reread.
	  And everything is started again (and listening ports if needed).
	- Ports for queries are shared.
	- config file added interface:, chroot: and username:.
	- config file: directory, logfile, pidfile. And they work too.
	- will daemonize by default now. Use -d to stay in the foreground.
	- got BSD random[256 state] code, made it threadsafe. util/random.

22 February 2007: Wouter
	- Have a config file. Removed commandline options, moved to config.

	  also makedist.sh, and manpage.
	- put include errno.h in config.h

19 February 2007: Wouter
	- Created 0.0 svn tag.
	- added acx_pthread.m4 autoconf check for pthreads from 
	  the autoconf archive. It is GPL-with-autoconf-exception Licensed.
	  You can specify --with-pthreads, or --without-pthreads to configure.

16 February 2007: Wouter
	- Updated testbed script, works better by using make on remote end.
	- removed check decls, we can compile without them.
	- makefile supports LIBOBJ replacements.
	- docs checks ignore compat code.
	- added util/mini-event.c and .h, a select based alternative used with
	  ./configure --with-libevent=no
	  It is limited to 1024 file descriptors, and has less features.
	- will not create ip6 sockets if ip6 not on the machine.

15 February 2007: Wouter
	- port to FreeBSD 4.11 Dec Alpha. Also works on Solaris 10 sparc64,
	  Solaris 9, FreeBSD 6, Linux i386 and OSX powerpc.
	- malloc rndstate, so that it is aligned for access.
	- fixed rbtree cleanup with postorder traverse.
	- fixed pending messages are deleted when handled.
	- You can control verbosity; default is not verbose, every -v
	  adds more verbosity.

14 February 2007: Wouter
	- Included configure.ac changes from ldns.
	- detect (some) headers before the standards check.
	- do not use isblank to test c99, since its not available on solaris9.
	- review of testcode.
		* entries in a RANGE are no longer reversed.
		* print name of file with replay entry parse errors.
	- port to OSX: cast to int for some prints of sizet.
	- Makefile copies ldnstestpkts.c before doing dependencies on it.

13 February 2007: Wouter
	- work on fake events, first fwd replay works.
	- events can do timeouts and errors on queries to servers.
	- test package that runs replay scenarios.

12 February 2007: Wouter
	- work on fake events.

9 February 2007: Wouter
	- replay file reading.
	- fake event setup, it creates fake structures, and teardowns,
	  added signal callbacks to reply to be able to fake those,
	  and main structure of event replay routines.

8 February 2007: Wouter
	- added tcp test.
	- replay storage.
	- testcode/fake_event work.

7 February 2007: Wouter
	- return answer with the same ID as query was sent with.
	- created udp forwarder test. I've done some effort to make it perform
	  quickly. After servers are created, no big sleep statements but
	  it checks the logfiles to see if servers have come up. Takes 0.14s.
	- set addrlen value when calling recvfrom.
	- comparison of addrs more portable.
	- LIBEVENT option for testbed to set libevent directory.
	- work on tcp input.

6 February 2007: Wouter

	- unit test for strisip6.

2 February 2007: Wouter
	- Created udp4 and udp6 port arrays to provide service for both
	  address families.
	- uses IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU for udp6 ,IPV6_V6ONLY to make ip6 sockets.
	- listens on both ip4 and ip6 ports to provide correct return address.
	- worker fwder address filled correctly.
	- fixup timer code.
	- forwards udp queries and sends answer.

23  January 2007: Wouter
	- added libevent to configure to link with.
	- util/netevent setup work.
	- configure searches for libevent.
	- search for libs at end of configure (when other headers and types
	  have been found).
	- doxygen works with ATTR_UNUSED().
	- util/netevent implementation.

22  January 2007: Wouter
	- Designed header file for network communication.

16  January 2007: Wouter
